Adds a Google No Captcha ReCaptcha checkbox to your Wordpress and Woocommerce login, forgot password, and user registration pages.

== Description ==

Adds a Google No Captcha ReCaptcha checkbox to your Wordpress and Woocommerce login, forgot password, and user registration pages. Denies access to automated scripts while making it easy on humans to log in by checking a box. As Google says, it is "Tough on bots, easy on humans."

== Installation ==

Install as normal for WordPress plugins.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why should I install this plugin? =

Many Worpdress sites are bombarded by automated scripts trying to log in to the admin over and over. 

The No Captcha is a very simple, Google-supported test to quickly deny access to automated scripts. It is great by itself to instantly make your Wordpress site more secure, or can be used with other plugins (like Google Authenticator, Limit Login Attempts, etc.) as part of a defense-in-depth strategy.

= There are a lot of other plugins for this, why should I install <em>this</em> one? =

I've gone to great lengths to try to make sure this plugin is easy to use and install, that it is compatible with different Wordpress configurations, supports multiple languages, and that you won't accidentally lock yourself out of the admin by using it. I use it myself on my own sites as well. So far, it just works.

= Can I help? =

Yes, please. Submit pull requests on <a href="https://github.com/cyberscribe/login-recaptcha">github</a>.

= I am having trouble with the reCAPTCHA in Internet Explorer =

Please see <a href="https://support.google.com/recaptcha/answer/6223838?hl=en">this page</a> for help from Google.

= I still see lots of brute force attacks against /wp-login.php in my log files =

The reCAPTCHA plugin will not prevent the attempt of brute force attacks, rather it will simply ensure that they do not succeed. That is, scripts may still attempt direct POST attacks against /wp-login.php, but without the correct reCAPTCHA data, they will not go through (even if they have guessed the login and password correctly). To prevent repeat attempts against /wp-login.php, consider using a plugin that <a href="https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/search.php?q=Limit+Login+Attempts">limits login attempts</a> in conjunction with this one. Other approaches, such as a <a href="https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/tags/web-application-firewall">web application firewall</a> should also form a part of your complete defense-in-depth strategy.
